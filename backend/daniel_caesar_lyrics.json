when we're both finished, then we'll have a reason to speak\n\n[Chorus]\nThen you can open up to me, girl\nLet me plant my seed, girl\nLet me fill your needs, girl\nOpen up to me, open up to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe piano that I fuck you on\nSame one that on which I write these songs for you\nThey're one in the same\nThat goes for us, too, I give you my name\nThe bed on which I lay to sleep\nAnd lay with you and lay in deep\nThere ain't no difference, this case there isn't\nThat goes for us, too, I know you're listenin\u2019\nSometimes it feels like I don\u2019t really care\nOne day you'll see, but in the meantime\nJust trust that I\u2019m there\nJust trust that I love you\nJust trust that I care\nTrust that I need you to always be there\nTrust that you know me well enough to know\nI'm the high priest but you put on the show\n\n[Chorus]\nThen you can open up to me, girl\nLet me plant my seed, girl\nLet me fill your needs, girl\nOpen up to me, open up to\u2014\n\n[Outro]\nIt's been such a long time\nSince I set foot in the club"}, {"Title": "FRONTAL LOBE MUZIK", "Album": {"api_path": "/albums/540105", "cover_art_url":

that's your lovin'\n\n[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]\nWanna feel it, something I can feel\nI know the things that I been feelin', they ain't real\nWanted to know what it felt like for them to like me\nNow I know, I gotta say, it's mighty frightening\nWanna use it, use my frontal lobe\nBut these feelings took this shit around the globe\nGod, I'm sick and tired of always feelin' lonely\nGot this Golden Child shit poppin' with my homies\nIt's a hell of a feeling, I put this thing on the map\nRemember back in the day you talked a whole lotta smack\nIt was hard for the black kid, you used to get at my gap\nUsed to steal all my groceries and now I get to the racks\nUsed to be ugly, but now I hit from the back\nThe side, from the front, and I swear this pussy like crack\nNigga got rhythm, I like to hear that shit clap\nI like to hear that shit back\nI like to hear that shit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nFurther from home, the unknown, is all that I know\nCouldn't atone on the phone\nI wish that I would be on my own, all alone\nI wish that I would quit bein' stoned, be a stone\nI wish that I would-\nI wish that I would just be a man when I can\nI wish you had the vision to follow the plan\nI wish I had a reason to see you again\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nYou know how I feel\nI'm in love with you still, ooh yeah\nIt helps, but it kills\nYour lovin', your lovin'\nIt hurts, it

feelin', they ain't real\nLook, my whole life they been beggin' me to chill\nGot it weighin' on my conscience just a lil'\nI wanna venture into the unknown\nNever got shit poppin' layin' 'round at
