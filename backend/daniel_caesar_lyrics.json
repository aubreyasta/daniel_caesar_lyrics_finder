I've finally found peace\nJust how long 'til she's stripped from me?\nSo come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze\nAin't no stoppin' that entropy\n\n[Verse 1]\nAm I just a dog who's found me a bone\nOr perhaps if I've found a home?\nBeen sniffin' around all over the town\nI just can't stop settlin' down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHis eye's on the sparrow, eyes is on me\nMore eyes than the KGB\nSometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed\nNot all at once, time flows linearly\nOnly forwards, never backwards\nSeek the darkness, seek the laughter\nRaise my jersey to the rafters\nLet moths consume me in the light\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, how can this be? I've finally found peace\nJust how long 'til she's stripped from me?\nSo come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze\nAin't no stoppin' that entropy\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo maybe my ego's out of control\nCan that be avoided? I don't know\nI hated myself when I was a boy\nNow that I don't, they're tryna take my joy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHis eye's on the sparrow, eyes is on me (Eye's on the sparrow)\nMore eyes than the KGB (KGB)\nSometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed (Sometimes)\nNot all at once, time flows linearly (Flows)\nOnly forwards, never backwards (Backwards)\nSeek the darkness, seek the laughter (Laughter)\nRaise my jersey to the rafters\nLet moths consume me in the light\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, how can this be?

My God\nJust tryna get money with my dogs\nIs that so wrong?\n\n[Chorus: Arianna Reid & Daniel Caesar]\nSubmit to me, come get down on one knee\nI'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need\n(That you need)\nSubmit to me, come get down on one knee\nI'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need\n\n[Verse 3]\nLately you've been on a wave\nSeen you lit up in the place\nSometimes you're sad, I see it on your face\nI can tell you're not okay\nI know you're only seeking out the beauty\nIn fulfilling your duty\nThe answers it seems\nAre inside your own dreams\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 4]\nGood God, Jehovah, what's this I see?\nMy mortality's staring back at me\nNiggas think I'm scared\nNiggas think I'm a bitch\nLike I ain't come prepared and I ain't know what this is\nI've slept like Jacob, a rock for a pillow\nRun swift like Elijah, away from the middle\nSeen the world, overindulged maybe a little\nBut now your boy is up, and I'm fit as a fiddle\nOh Lord, Jehovah, what's this I see?\nBourgeoisie tryna silence me\nThey don't know what I've been through\nDon't know what I pree'd\nSeen shit that you see up in your TV screen\nFollow me to salvation\nYour mind still 'pon plantations\nThe shepherd, holds information\nGives it out as its taken\nYeah, yeah"

Or do you wanna take it farther\nLeave the woman that you'd break your heart for at the altar\n'Cause you were offered a life that you would trade your heart for\nAin't gotta die to see heaven, I got your heaven nigga\nWould rather rev on an engine than ever reverend, nigga\nBlack sheeps packing weapons in 911's, nigga\nHow could worship be worth it?\nYou love your God like yourself\nSo you deserve to be perfect\nYou deserve for your car to skrrt and your girl to be skirtless\nFuck on a Saturday nigga, miss Sunday service\nYou made you a hundred verses, a hundred verses\nThat's why you need you a hundred virgins, a hundred virgins\nYeah, you wear your crown with a frown sometimes\nYou can't help but feel down at times\nYou were raised in the basement\nYou used to pray on your spaceship\n\n[Outro: Daniel Caesar]\nI gotta make something for myself, myself\nIf you want to get this money, come and join me\nIf you want to get this money, come and join me\nIf you want to get this money, come and join me\nIf you want to get this money, come and join me"

If I lay you down, just hop out, bitch)\nHow 'bout if I lay you down (My fault, if I lay you down, just)\nStarting today (Hop out, if I lay you down, was it my fault, bitch?)\n\n[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]\nI guess I got what I prayed for\nAngels over head\nAnd yeah, it's not what I slaved for\nWorked myself to death\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nI know you think you got me wrapped around your fingers\nAnd what's behind those cold dead eyes? A life lingers\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nHow 'bout if I lay you down? (My fault if I lay you down)\nYou gotta go too often (Was it my fault? If I lay you down, just hop out, bitch)\nHow 'bout if I lay you down (My fault, if I lay you down, just)\nStarting today (Hop out, if I lay you down, was it my fault, bitch?)\nHow 'bout if I lay you down?\nYou gotta go too often\nHow 'bout if I lay you down\nStarting today\n\n[Outro: Omar Apollo]\nI wouldn't chang\u0435\nOh, I wouldn't dare to change\nHow I feel about you\nHow I feel about it"
